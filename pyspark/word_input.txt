This is an iterative machine learning algorithm that seeks to find the best hyperplane that separates two sets of points in a multi-dimensional feature space. It can be used to classify messages into spam vs non-spam, for example. Because the algorithm applies the same MapReduce operation repeatedly to the same dataset, it benefits greatly from caching the input in RAM across iterations.
